Compumedics Neuroscan GmbH
September, 2016

TCP/IP client implementation for communication with CURRY. The demo allows to 
establish a connection to a server and retreive and display EEG waveforms. When
available, event data and impedance values are also received and displayed in 
the logs.

This demo makes use of the TCP/UDP/IP Toolbox 2.0.6 by Peter Rydesäter 
(see license in corresponding folder).
